# Get Started

## Get Start with basic_calc
REQUIRES PYTHON VERSION 3.10 OR LATER

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/import-brain/basic_calc/releases). Then extract it using an unzipping utility (WinRar, 7Zip, unzip command for Linux aficionados, etc.). And lastly scroll down until you find a file named something similar to "calc.exe" for your operating system. This file is the calculator. Enjoy! :)

Or aquire the [calc.py](https://github.com/import-brain/basic_calc/blob/main/calc.py) File and run it once downloading is complete.
